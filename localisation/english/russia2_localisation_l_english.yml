 russia2_russia.5.d:0 "Recent political turmoil in [FROM.GetNameDef] has left its government with a strong vision for the future that aligns with our own plans. They seek our protection and offer their unconditional support. Officially they will continue as a nation of their own, but they will follow the Motherland in every move."
 russia2_russia.5.a:0 "Another tool to aid our progress."

 russia2_russia.6.t:0 "Estonia Submits"
 russia2_russia.6.d:0 "Estonia has surrendered to our demands. We have replaced the decadent government in Tallinn with a People's Parliament, which has unanimously voted to convert Estonia into a Soviet Socialist Republic. After deliberations, the Supreme Soviet has decided to accept this request."
 russia2_russia.6.a:0 "You are [ROOT.GetAdjective] now!"
 russia2_russia.7.t:0 "Estonia Refuses Our Offer"
 russia2_russia.7.d:0 "Estonia has outrageously decided to refuse our generous offer of a mutual assistance pact! The capitalists and sycophants in Tallinn have further had the gall to issue a statement demanding that we respect the territorial integrity of their nation!"
 russia2_russia.7.a:0 "We must protect the Estonians from themselves."
 russia2_russia.8.t:0 "Latvia Submits"
 russia2_russia.8.d:0 "The Latvian government in Riga has agreed to our demands, and we have replaced their corrupt rule with a People's Assembly.

 russia2_russia.9.t:0 "Latvia Refuses Our Offer"
 russia2_russia.9.d:0 "The bourgeoisie oppressors ruling Latvia have chosen to abandon all reason. They have rejected our generous mutual assistance pact, and are demanding the immediate withdrawal of all Soviet forces 'massing' along their border."
 russia2_russia.9.a:0 "Latvian people must be liberated."
 russia2_russia.10.t:0 "Lithuania Submits"
 russia2_russia.10.d:0 "Our request for military bases in Lithuania has been granted, but unfortunately their government has collapsed. We have established a People's Parliament to avoid anarchy, and they have unanimously voted to petition the Supreme Soviet for membership in our union. This request has been granted."
 russia2_russia.10.a:0 "You are [ROOT.GetAdjective] now!"
 russia2_russia.11.t:0 "Lithuania Refuses Our Offer"
 russia2_russia.11.d:0 "Lithuania seems bent on self-destruction, and the fools in their government are denying our forces' access to their country. Do they think they would be better off under the Germans? Their selfish leaders are committing a crime against the people by denying their citizens true socialism."
 russia2_russia.11.a:0 "Lithuanian people have suffered enough."
 russia2_russia.12.t:0 "[FIN.GetNameDef] Proposes Unification"
 russia2_russia.12.d:0 "The Finnish Communism party, officially under our direct ruling has suggested that it would be best for them to join the Union as one. After a close Referendum, the Finnish people decided that they want to be part of the Revolution and be considered as Russians."
 russia2_russia.12.a:0 "Our words to the Finnish citizens: \"You are now Russians, and part of the revolution\"."
 russia2_russia.12.b:0 "No, the Finnish people don't deserve the right to be part of the Union."

 russia2_russia.15.d:0 "It has finally happened. Unthinkable a few months back, we now control our original key cities and can call ourselves Russia again.\n\nWe shall never let the Germans or anyone else take our precious territory again, and we shall rebuild the country as new. For the Motherland!"
 russia2_russia.15.a:0 "The good ending for us."
 russia2_russia.18.t:0 "The Peasants' Strikes"
 russia2_russia.18.d:0 "We should have kept them in check! The Peasants have announced massive gatherings and active guerilla all over the country. We're definitely in trouble now."
 russia2_russia.18.a:0 "There's only one choice left now... Crush Them!"
 russia2_russia.19.t:0 "The White Death"
 russia2_russia.19.d:0 "A Finnish sniper, hidden in the snow like a wolf, is decimating our men one by one. He made his name along with our ranks : The White Death. Our soldiers' morale on the battlefield is at its lowest as they fear bullets coming from under the snow."
 russia2_russia.19.a:0 "Can't somebody kill him?!"
 russia2_russia.20.t:0 "Training our New Officers"
 russia2_russia.20.d:0 "With the recent purge of some of our top officers, the high ranks in the army are in a bad shape. Low training and experience of the battlefield mean our officers are here more as a figure than as actual officers. We have to give them special training about the future of warfare."
 russia2_russia.20.a:0 "Attack is the best defense!"
 russia2_russia.20.b:0 "We shall defend our position until the enemy can send no more."
 russia2_russia.20.c:0 "Good logistics is the key to keep morale high."
 russia2_russia.20.e:0 "A master plan always comes first."
 russia2_russia.21.t:0 "The Fate of our Polish Prisoners"
 russia2_russia.21.d:0 "After our recent invasion of Poland, we've managed to capture a bunch of Polish soldiers and other counterrevolutionaries. They have been deported to special camps made in a hurry for them. Now the question is what should we do about them? If they are not dealt with immediately they could oppose us in the future and thus be a direct threat to our country. However, this could be a perfect opportunity to take our revenge on them after the humiliating defeat of the Soviet-Polish war of 1919 and the peace treaty of Riga, 1921."
 russia2_russia.21.a:0 "Don't give them any opportunity!"
 russia2_russia.21.b:0 "We're not monsters."
 russia2_russia.22.t:0 "Discovery of a Prison"
 russia2_russia.22.d:0 "Today, our soldiers discovered in Smolensk what we believe to be a prison of Polish POWs and other ethnicities. We suspect that this was the doing of [SOV.GetNameDef] and from what we dug up, at least 4 thousand people have been found! We could maybe use this as an opportunity to try to sway the allies with us against our war with the red menace."
 russia2_russia.22.a:0 "... Perhaps..."
 russia2_russia.23.t:0 "The Last Revolution"
 russia2_russia.23.d:0 "Although countless people have been executed and imprisoned as traitors and counterrevolutionaries over the past years, leading positions have been largely safe. They have not been exempt from suspicion, however. With the creation of the Fourth International, Stalin appears possessed by the thought that those closest to him were never truly on his side. Those who try to gain his trust have further fueled this idea to cast themselves in a better light.\n\nThe current situation is one of exceptional irony: the distrust within the current administration has rendered it unsustainable, and a coup is now imminent. Can this plan, which has been the General Secretary's greatest fear for years, truly be executed?"
 russia2_russia.23.a:0 "Unthinkable!"
 soviet.23.a_tt:0 "§YA massive civil war will break out soon.§!"

 russia2_russia.23.b_tt:0 "In order to bring back §YLeon Trotsky§!, you need to choose the focus §YAvoid the Purge§!, otherwise you can't."
 russia2_russia.24.t:0 "The Great Purge Begins"
 russia2_russia.24.d:0 "The persecution of enemies of the people, those who would reverse or subvert the revolution, has been ongoing policy since the Party came to power. The internal power struggles that followed have shifted our focus, and purging the Party ranks themselves has been given more emphasis since Trotsky's exile. Stalin has made himself an icon but at the cost of making many real enemies and innumerable imaginary ones.\n\nHaving seen the worst of internal power struggles, the General Secretary is prone to act on the slightest suspicion. Being purged from the Party means imprisonment or death. Dark times lie ahead for those who show disloyalty - or just a bit too much loyalty to seem credible."
 russia2_russia.24.a:0 "Dark times ahead."
 SOV_great_purge_begins_tt:0 "§YNikolay Yezhov§! replaces §YGenrikh Yagoda§! as §YHead of the NKVD§!.\nAdds §YThe Great Purge§! national spirit, which will increase §RPenalties§! for each §RPurge§!.\n£decision_icon_small Unlocks Decisions : §YThe Great Purge§!"
 russia2_russia.25.t:0 "The Great Purge Ends"
 russia2_russia.25.d:0 "The Purge is over. The enemies of the people are dead or cowed into submission. Stalin’s once infamous lists are no longer being handed out. As people begin to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives and the families of those purged begin to fall into a new sense of normalcy, no matter how different that may be than their previous ones, few doubt that the General Secretaries position is now rock solid. What resistance to his rule had existed in the Party, passive or not, has been thoroughly crushed. All that is left to wonder is what Secretary Stalin will do with such unlimited power, power that even the most fanatical dictators could only dream of."
 russia2_russia.25.a:0 "Finally, we are done."
 SOV_great_purge_ends_tt:0 "§YLavrentiy Beria§! replaces §YNikolay Yezhov§! as §YHead of the NKVD§!.\n§YDecisions§! can now be taken to remove [GetCurrentPurgeTexticonScale] §RThe Great Purge Penalties§!."

 russia2_russia.26.t:0 "The Great Purge Cancelled"
 russia2_russia.26.d:0 "The Purge has come to a premature end due to... Extenuating circumstances. No matter what forced the end of the Purge, its effects still reverberate throughout Russia. With the suspicion never fully satiated at the top before its end, it was never allowed to dispel amongst the commoners. People still live in fear that the purge is not really over but has just entered a new and deadly phase. Accusations of treason still fly in town squares, taverns, and homes as neighbors eye each other with newfound suspicion. Meanwhile, at the top, the paranoia has mainly subsided as the administration settles into its new roles. The era of fear at the top is over, but it has only just begun amongst the common man."

 russia2_russia.28.d:0 "After removing most political opponents, we are now faced a much bigger problem : outside politics. Our country may be stabilized, but we have to choose a way with foreign affairs, such as choosing our future allies and enemies. Molotov seems pretty inexperienced and interested in an alliance with [GER.GetNameDef]. Against him, Maisky, who kept warning the democratic nations against the rise of fascism in Europe, pleading for an alliance. Maisky has been pretty unsuccessful at convincing the capitalist nations, \"They do not seem to realize how big of a threat [GER.GetLeader] is, but I am sure they will soon enough.\" is what he said. Should we keep on trusting him, or make a different approach by choosing Molotov?"
 russia2_russia.28.a:0 "Trust Molotov! Enact an Anti-Capitalism diplomacy."

 russia2_russia.30.d:0 "Sakhalin has been source of troubles for us and Japan for quite some time now. We rightfully claim that Sakhalin is part of Siberia, while the Japanese claim that its part of their empire and sphere of influence. To avoid any conflict in the future, finding a solution now would be the best solution."
 russia2_russia.30.a:0 "Ask for South Sakhalin."

 russia2_russia.33.a:0 "Who cares about this block of ice anyways?"
 russia2_russia.34.t:0 "[JAP.GetNameDefCap] Refuses our Treaty"
 russia2_russia.34.d:0 "Our treaty was brutally denied by the Japanese government. They do not think of us as trustworthy and answered with swift words : \"Japan shall take over Sakhalin and all of Siberia when it pleases\"."
 russia2_russia.34.a:0 "The fools!"
 russia2_russia.35.t:0 "South Sakhalin Seized!"
 russia2_russia.35.d:0 "Our troops successfully seized the Southern part of Sakhalin and forced Japanese garrisons to retreat!"
 russia2_russia.35.a:0 "They took Manchuria, We take Sakhalin!"
 russia2_russia.36.t:0 "Red Army Retreats from Sakhalin"
 russia2_russia.36.d:0 "Our army was defeated in the surprise invasion of South Sakhalin. Perhaps our little plan was discovered by the Japanese? Japan could not afford to launch an offensive back with their garrison, but Tokyo made sure to denounce Russia as a warmongering nation. All diplomatic ties have been cut off."
 russia2_russia.36.a:0 "These damn Japanese are unbeatable."
 russia2_russia.37.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts!"
 russia2_russia.37.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to our demands and rushed to Moscow to meet with us, claiming that they'll be a trustworthy ally we can rely on. Whether this has to do with our pressure or not, this is good news for us. We shall honor our part of the treaty."

 russia2_russia.40.a:0 "We'll crush them."
 russia2_russia.41.t:0 "The Assassination of Stalin"
 russia2_russia.41.d:0 "The country government is plunged into chaos, Stalin can hardly hold his power over the party and for this reason it's the perfect moment to strike the tyrant down. However, we have to decide which group is going to handle the assassination."

He joined the Imperial Russian Army at just 21 and served valiantly in The Great Patriotic War of 1914. When the Workers rose up against their oppressive masters in 1917 this scion of a noble house joined with them. Since then he has been a critical cog in the machine of the Red Army. His work during the Civil War and Polish-Soviet War has made him famous across the nation and the world, bringing him within a hair's breadth of spreading the Revolution to the entire Continent! However, ultimately he failed. Since then he has been a proponent of “Deep Battle” using combined arms to break the enemy line and drive deep behind them. This, however, all is just a front to hide his true traitorous intentions. It is no secret Tukhachevsky has hated Stalin since his own failure in Poland which he pinned unfairly on the now General Secretary but who was then a general like him. This tipped Stalin off to Tukhachevsky’s true motives. Finally, however, Stalin’s hunch has proven correct.\n\nIn 1930 a confession was extracted by the ever-loyal NKVD that proved Tukhachevsky was plotting with a cabal of officers to overthrow Stalin in favor of Nikolai Bukharin. We have finally arrested the traitor and have even gotten him to sign a confession of his own guilt. While the veracity of any admission signed under duress of torture is suspect, his signature is still on the paper. This gives us more than enough proof to end this traitor's life. However, while Stalin wants to kill him off and be done with the matter, he has heard suggestions that we can finally cow the openly ambitious general. With this signed confession we can hang over his head he will be unable to cause much of a fuss lest we publish it and dispatch him. However, the choice is not up to anybody but Stalin himself, and he has finally made a decision."

He was drafted into the Russian Army in 1915 and earned the Cross of St George twice and was wounded in battle against the Germans in WWI. As a cavalry officer, he proved himself capable and was an early defector to the Bolsheviks in 1917. In the Red Army, he served valiantly and earned the Order of the Red Banner for his part in subduing the 1921 Antonovschina. Since then, as an officer, he has risen rapidly through the ranks and while still rather low on the rung he shows real promise.\n\nDespite all of this Zhukov has gained Stalin’s attention. His peasant background has made him a political darling in the press and his exploits have recently gained the attention of the Russian people who desperately seek heroes. This has grown his public figure a fair bit and, in Stalin’s eyes, made him a threat. While the NKVD have yet to start seriously investigating him, Stalin has a hunch that Zhukov is an undercover counterrevolutionary. He works not for the interests of Stalin, and by extension the Soviet people, but for his own. All of his bravery and heroism were just self-serving moves to make his post War career easier. Who's to say he isn’t contacting Trotsky right now promising to use his rising star to catapult that old bastard to the top. Then he would use Trotsky as a puppet for his own sinister designs. Stalin knows there is dirt on that boy, and even a cursory investigation would find what he wants. However, his talents are undeniable. As the Purge has gone on it has hit the Red Army particularly hard. To kill off another talented young officer could cripple the Army for a generation or more, more so than it has already. Stalin must decide if that is worth it."

He joined the Bolsheviks early on as well and led the Party since 1919 as Chairman of the Presidium. As an ally of Stalin after Lenin’s death, he was allowed to hold onto his titles as Stalin consolidated power under himself. Despite his title of nominal head of state, it's clear to all that Kalinin has little if any power in decision-making. Sometimes his friend Stalin may put him on a committee but few listen to his input or take it seriously. He is more like a seat warmer, to at least attempt the facade of Stalin not having absolute power. However, his title, no matter how powerless, still remains the same. He is still technically the second most powerful man in the USSR behind Stalin himself. Should his head grow too big for his shoulders then he could pose a serious threat to the General Secretary. Not only that but Kalinin has a history of known or suspected treason. He was an alleged Cheka spy for the Tsarists, he stood against Lenin and with the Mensheviks in support of the Kerensky dictatorship. This history of disloyalty to the Bolshevik party line, along with his position, make him a credible threat in the future, even if he isn't one now. Stalin has come to the conclusion that Kalinin must be disposed of to eliminate any potential future threat. However, it is true that Kalinin is not a threat now, and despite past disloyalty has shown himself to be at best resigned to his position of powerlessness. He is already neutralized. Should Stalin really take out a man who is no real threat?"

He joined the Bolsheviks in 1905 and after the Bolsheviks seized power he joined the military, first meeting Stalin when he helped him coordinate the defense of Tsaritsyn, now known as Stalingrad. Furthermore, he served as General of the 1st Cavalry Army during the Soviet-Polish War fighting on the Southern Front along with Stalin. This has gained him much favor with the General Secretary. With the…convenient death of Frunze Voroshilov only rose higher until by 1935 he was Marshal of the Soviet Union. He has stuck to his political patron even with the ongoing Purges. Voroshilov has been instrumental in denouncing many of his former friends who fell afoul of Moscow and he personally has signed off on many executions. This eagerness to aid in the cleansing of the Revolution has been admirable…and suspicious. Why would someone be so eager to so loudly denounce comrades in arms he dined with just days ago? Why would he be so publicly for the Purges if not to throw suspicion off of his own trail? Stalin and the NKVD have come to the conclusion that Voroshilov’s full-throated defense of the Purge has been nothing but a smokescreen. He seeks to mask himself in patriotism so that he can carry out his nefarious counter-revolutionary goals without challenge. He however did not count on Stalin and the NKVD being five steps ahead of him. The pieces have all fallen into place, all that matters now is to make our move. Despite this, there have been urges to not strike at Voroshilov. His support has lent the Purge a pillar of legitimacy. To strike him down not only would undercut the Purges but also keep others from speaking out in support as well."

 russia2_russia.558.d:0 "For some time now Lavrentiy Beria and Genrikh Yagoda have been feuding over leadership of the NKVD. For his part, Yagoda has been with the Bolsheviks, including Stalin, since its inception. He has led the state security apparatus in one way or another since 1924 first as head of the OGPU and then as head of the NKVD since 1934. As such he has had a hand in most of the dirty dealings done by Stalin. He helped plan the assassination of Kirov, has been instrumental in organizing the Purges, and has rooted out opposition within the party with ruthless efficiency. However, he is not spotless. He is not a Stalin loyalist, as shown by his opposition to the mass collectivization push. He also failed to notice the significant conspiratorial Opposition Bloc that had been forming in the Party for years, only finding it in 1932. Not only that but his history in the Party means he knows much of the dirty things Stalin has done. If he revealed his secrets he could ruin Stalin, or blackmail him just the same. Stalin has come to suspect Yagoda’s loyalty and has debated sending out his squads to round him up for disloyalty and Trotskyism. However his likely successor Lavrentiy Beria is not a spotless replacement either.\n\nLavrentiy Beria is a newer man in the Party, having only joined in the early 1920s. However, since then he has proven his ability to do what is ordered of him. He has already organized the repression of the Georgian Nationalist uprising in 1924, foiled a planned assassination, led the Purges in the Transcaucasian region, and has vocally promoted Stalin’s historical role in the Transcaucasian Revolutionary struggle. All of this said and done he still has some skeletons in his closet. Early on he worked for the Musavat in Azerbaijan who were explicitly anti-Bolsheviks. This is proof of disloyalty and we have executed more important people for less. Should we strike at him now? Or maybe Yagoda? If we take out one the other will become so powerful that we wouldn’t dare take them on, so if we choose we must do so wisely."

He remained in Stalin’s good graces despite his own lackluster performance in the Civil War and the Polish-Soviet War, rising along with Stalin. Now he runs the Main Artillery Directorate and has proven himself unequal to the task. He prefers the Red Army to remain in the thought of 1918, distrusting things like Tanks, anti-tank guns, and even experimental weapons like the one codenamed Katyusha. He has harshly criticized Tukhachevsky and his mechanization efforts and has even gone so far as to delay the production of T-34 and KV-1 tanks despite orders to the contrary. All of this has given Stalin a newfound suspicion of his old friend. He may feel safe and secure under Stalin’s umbrella but all of that will soon change. His outright hostility to necessary reform and disobeying direct orders in concerns to tank production have outed him as a traitor, a wrecker, and a saboteur. Stalin has his pen ready to write, all he must do now is put it to paper. However, even now at this final moment, the Secretary hesitates. Is he really about to do this?

Not only that but he rises along with Beria and has no ties to Stalin directly. Should Beria ever turn on Stalin, Merkulov won't be far behind. While striking at Beria would be inadvisable for many reasons, Merkulov’s relative anonymity is a plus.

He served in Finland, Japan, and the UK. As of now, he remains in London as the official Soviet ambassador to the Court of St James. While there, under Litonov’s direction, he has spent a lot of time assuaging the Western Capitalists' instinctive fear of the Soviet Union. Despite this noble service, however, Stalin has grown weary of the man. He was at first a fervent anti-Bolshevik. At first, he joined the Mensheviks before joining the Kerensky government and hanging on to the White Government until defeat seemed inevitable in 1919. This disloyalty did not escape Stalin’s notice and now Stalin might think it's past time he paid for his treachery. However, Maisky has gained the trust of the British. If he were recalled and purged it would be seen as a decisive turn away from the West, one that could prove irreversible.\n\nVyacheslav Molotov has also fallen into suspicion. Molotov himself is a great man in Bolshevik history. He joined the party in 1916 and helped coordinate the putsch in St Petersburg in 1917. Afterward, he fell into Stalin’s camp and never left. He has stuck by his political patron through thick and thin and was quick to defend the purge at its beginning. He has also taken a more proactive stance in foreign affairs, garnering a rivalry with Litonov and Maisky. Now, however, Stalin has seemingly turned on his old friend. Motolov has spoken out against Stalin before, though never as severely as he could have, and as Vice Premier he has spoken on improving relations with Nazi Germany. This has offended Stalin who recognizes the Nazis as the threats they are. However, all of this together is not strictly treason and Stalin has heed and hawed back and forth on whether to go through with getting rid of Molotov. However, the wait has come to an end.

He quickly distinguished himself as a talented administrator and in 1925 he joined the Communist Party Congress. It was there he met Lazar Kaganovich, a loyal Stalinist and chief enforcer of the Party line. As Kaganovich’s star rose, Kruschev's star was not far behind. Finally, by 1932 Stalin and Khruschev were meeting personally and the two became fast friends. Since then Stalin has looked after his young protege and Khrushchev has paid back his kindness by remaining a staunch ally of the regime. However, as Stalin’s paranoia has grown doubts have arisen over Khruschev’s real loyalty. The NKVD has uncovered letters indicating Khrushchev was once a Trotskyist or at least leaned towards the disgraced official through 1923. They even claim to have a signed denouncement from a recently imprisoned traitor implicating Khruschev in outright treason. There are even rumors that when confronted by Kaganovich personally Khrushchev admitted his guilt. All of this ruminates in Stalin's mind and remains up to him to see what must be done."

During the Civil War, he fought across Eastern Russia from Poland to Ukraine and gained much experience. During this time he ended up helping Stalin defend Tsaritsyn, now known as Stalingrad, from the Whites and became a good friend of the future General Secretary. He, along with his other ‘Cavalry Clique’ officers Semyon Budyonny and Kliment Voroshilov, has used his friendship with Stalin to rise through the ranks and now has settled into running the military district of [GetKievAdjective]. He has proven himself to not be particularly gifted in the military sciences but competent enough for an officer that Stalin can, or at least could, trust him. By now, however, it seems that trust has run out. Stalin has come to distrust his old friend. His quiet competence has made him reliable to many people, people who may seek to plot against Stalin. By eliminating him Stalin could undercut any future plans. However, the sword cuts both ways. Semyon is a good man and a competent officer in a Red Army sorely lacking both. Above that, he is a good friend to Stalin and despite his cold calculations, such a fact still makes Stalin hesitate. In the end, the choice must always be made. Should Stalin send a good man to die to stop a plot not yet hatched, or should he save his friend and give the Red Army a man it will sorely need in the coming years?"

 russia2_russia.565.d:0 "Alexander Yegorov is a man with a storied military history. As a proud Russian, he joined the Imperial Army in 1902 and was part of the Army that suppressed the 1905 Revolution. In 1904 he joined the SR’s and served valiantly in WWI, being wounded five times and promoted to Lt Colonel. When the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917 Yegorov quickly realized which way the winds were blowing and joined the Red Army and during the Civil War, he commanded the Southwestern Front, technically outranking the future General Secretary who also served in this body. Despite this, the two grew to like each other. In 1931 Yegorov was named Chief of the Soviet General Staff, in 1934 he was a candidate for the Central Committee and in 1935 he became one of the first Marshals of the Soviet Union soon after the rank was created. His friendship with Stalin has shielded him from the Purges so far but now his time seems to be up. A number of letters, principally from divisional commanders in the Frunze Military Academy, have raised questions about Yegorov’s competence. Was it not him who commanded the Southwest Front which failed to aid Soviet forces during the Battle of Warsaw? He did help suppress the 1905 Revolution and he only joined the Bolsheviks after they seized power. All of this and more has left Stalin and the NKVD questioning his loyalty. Stalin, while liking the man, has no real opinion one way or another."

Thereafter he would serve his motherland as a factory worker and joined the Bolsheviks in 1916 and the Revolution in 1917. In 1918 he joined the Red Army and distinguished himself as commander of the Southern Urals Partisan Army when he marched his men 1500km (932 mi) in 40 days to attack the revolting Czech Legion in the rear. This achievement netted him the first Order of the Red Banner ever given out, he would go on to win it four more times. After that, he served briefly in Southern Russia before being sent to the Far East to dislodge White forces holding out there. Since then he has served out there in various commands, even serving as military attache to Chaing Kai-Shek in the 1920s. In 1930 he decisively fought off an attempt by Chinese warlord Zhang Xuilang to nationalize the Manchurian Chinese Eastern Railway. This granted him the first-ever Order of the Red Star and the moniker the Red Napoleon. Since then he has remained in command of the Far East and granted an unusual amount of autonomy to deal with the Japanese. This ends now, however. Recently the head of the Far East NKVD Genrikh Lyushkov defected to Japan and was able to sneak over the Manchu border. This is an inexcusable dereliction of duty on Blyukher’s part and can only be explained by his secretly treasonous feelings."

In September he joined the Red Guards in Moscow and a unit under his direction helped storm the Kremlin, during which Frinovksy was severely wounded. After a short time back in civilian life, Frinovsky joined the Communist Party in July of 1918 and the Red Army soon after, being named Commissar of the 1st Cavalry Army. In 1919 he was transferred and promoted to the deputy head of the Moscow Cheka where he oversaw crackdowns of dissidents who threatened the very survival of the government. However, from late 1919 to late 1923 Firnovsky was sent to Southern Ukraine and the Caucuses to round up and destroy fifth columnists. However, in 1927 he was sent back to Moscow and climbed the ranks of the NKVD, eventually becoming head of their Internal Troops. The recent purges have only benefited him as well. Many of his enemies like Yagoda and Beria have been damaged by suspicions while his friends like Yazov remain to grow only more powerful, bringing him up with them. However, his rise to power has spooked Stalin. He has begun to suspect that all of his suspicions about all of these enemies come from inventions made by Frinovsky. That treacherous snake looks out not for the safety and security of the people, but only for himself! Stalin has printed his name on several lists at the very top in big letters.

In 1920 he was stationed in Petrograd and in 1924, he along with his unit, attended the funeral of Vladimir Lenin and he soon after joined the Communist Party. After graduating from Frunze Higher Naval School in 1926 he was assigned as watch officer for the cruiser Chernova Ukraina, eventually rising to First Lt. In 1932 he studied operational tactics at the Naval College and after graduating was offered two choices, a desk job with a general staff or the command of a ship. Perhaps unsurprisingly he chose the ship and was assigned the command of the cruiser Krasny Kavkaz. Within a year he had achieved his next promotion and returned to the Chernova Ukraina, now as its commander. Under his command, the Ukraina has become an example of exemplary discipline and organization. As of now, he spends his time as the chief naval attache to Republican Spain. However, this rising naval star has drawn the suspicion of Stalin. His humble background, tied with his undeniable skill, makes him a pillar of the Soviet Navy, and if he gets big ideas he could go far…too far. Not only that but reports of Kuznetzov speaking openly in opposition to the purge of his officers have reached Stalin’s ears. Stalin has decided he must take him out now or risk a coup."

Afterward, he was assigned to the Baltic Fleet on the cruiser Bogatyr. He began as a fireman and a machinist before becoming a noncommissioned officer. After the 1917 Revolution, he was elected as the Chairman of the Sailors Committee of the Coastal Artillery in Reval. In September however he was forced out of the Navy due to a severe illness and he moved back home. After the October Revolution, he led the local Committee of the Poor Peasants and the local Soviet. In 1918 he joined the Communist Party formally and the Red Volunteers. In February of the next year, he joined the Red Army Navy and served in the Caspian naval flotillas during the Civil War, defending Astrakhan mostly. From 1920 - 1921 he served in the Baltic Fleet once more, this time aboard the battleship Marat. During the Kronstadt Uprising, he was arrested by the rebels and jailed for the entire rebellion, being freed by Soviet soldiers storming the fort. He remained with the Baltic Fleet until transfer to the Black Sea in 1926. Since then he has proved his competence time and again. Now, however, as the Purge tears through the Navy, Yumashev has come under suspicion. If he was such a loyal Bolshevik why didn't he try and escape Kronstadt?

When the February Revolution broke out a year later however he was demobilized and sent home. In 1918 he joined the Bolsheviks and the Red Army, returning to the Artillery. During the Civil War, he served in the Far East under Voroshilov. During this time he formed connections with Stalin and Voroshilov both. After the Civil War, he graduated from Frunze Military Academy and has used his ties to Stalin and Voroshilov to get more and more senior commands in the Far East. However, Stalin has become convinced Konev is manipulating him and has prepared him to die. Now all that remains to be seen is if he will go through with it.\n\nKonstantin Rokossovsky was born in Warsaw, the scion of a noble family which had produced a long line of cavalry officers, even though his dad was a railway worker and his mom was a teacher. At 14 he was orphaned and found work at a stocking factory. In 1911 he became a stonemason and worked as one until 1914 when he volunteered in the Russian Army, Russifying his name from its more Polish original. He served bravely and excellently in the cavalry throughout the war, ending the War as a junior non-commissioned officer and with two wounds. In 1917 he joined the Bolsheviks and Red Army. During the Civil War, he led a cavalry detachment in the Urals and in 1919 was wounded by an officer he later killed when he overran the officers' headquarters. For his bravery, he received the Order of the Red Banner. In 1921 Rokossovsky helped defeat the remnant White Russians ruling Mongolia, led by Roman von Ungern-Sternberg. After a short stint in cavalry school in Leningrad, during which he first met Gregory Zhukov, he returned to Mongolia to train the Mongol Army and went on to help the USSR take over the Manchurian railways in 1930. Since then he has held a variety of senior commands, until now. Semyon Budyonny, among others, has spoken out and accused Rokossovksy of being a Polish spy. His traitorous wrap has been given credence by his closeness to the traitor Mikhail Tukhachevsky, both of whom loudly support the development of tanks, who have had similar suspicions raised about him.

After Stalin's death, he was the one to have the most knowledge and the one Stalin could trust, thus he succeeded in leading the Soviet Union.

He advised Mikhail Alekseyev of the Volunteer Army. Milyukov and Struve defended a Great Russia as firmly as the most reactionary monarchist. In May 1918 he went to Kiev, where he negotiated with the German high command to act together against the Bolsheviks. For many members of the Cadet Party, this went too far: Milyukov was forced to resign the presidency of the KDP Central Committee.

 anarchist_desc:0 "Anarchy is the state of a society being freely constituted without authorities or a governing body. It may also refer to a society or group of people that entirely rejects a set hierarchy. Anarchists seek a system based on the abolishment of all unjustified, coercitive hierarchy and the creation of system of direct democracy and worker cooperatives."
 anarcho_syndicalism_sub:0 "Anarcho-Syndicalism"
 anarcho_syndicalism_sub_desc:0 "Anarcho-syndicalism is a political philosophy and anarchist school of thought that views revolutionary industrial unionism or syndicalism as a method for workers in capitalist society to gain control of an economy and thus control influence in broader society. The end goal of syndicalism is to abolish the wage system, regarding it as wage slavery. Anarcho-syndicalist theory therefore generally focuses on the labour movement."
 anarcho_communism_sub:0 "Anarcho-Communism"
 anarcho_communism_sub_desc:0 "Anarcho-communism, also known as anarchist communism, is a political philosophy and anarchist school of thought which advocates the abolition of the state, capitalism, wage labour, social hierarchies and private property (while retaining respect for personal property, along with collectively-owned items, goods and services) in favor of common ownership of the means of production and direct democracy."
 individualist_anarchism_sub:0 "Individualist Anarchism"
 individualist_anarchism_sub_desc:0 "Individualist anarchism is the branch of anarchism that emphasizes the individual and their will over external determinants such as groups, society, traditions and ideological systems. Although usually contrasted to social anarchism, both individualist and social anarchism have influenced each other. Mutualism, an economic theory particularly influential within individualist anarchism whose pursued liberty has been called the synthesis of communism and property, has been considered sometimes part of individualist anarchism."
